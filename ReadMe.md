##  Bill of Materials (BOM)

- A complete list of components and part numbers is provided in:  
  **`BOM.xls`**

---

## 🛠 CAD Files

- Full mechanical assembly in STEP format:  
  **`CAD Files/LongLegQuadAssembly Final.STEP`**

- Use any CAD software that supports `.STEP` files (e.g., SolidWorks, Fusion 360, FreeCAD) to view or modify.
